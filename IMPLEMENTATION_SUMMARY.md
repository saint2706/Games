## Implementation Details

### Code Quality

- ✅ All games extend `GameEngine` base class
- ✅ Type hints on all functions and methods
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- ✅ Formatted with `black` (160 char line length)
- ✅ Linted with `ruff` (all issues resolved)
- ✅ Follows repository patterns and conventions

### Testing

- ✅ 6 new test cases added to `tests/test_new_paper_games.py`
- ✅ All 13 tests passing (7 existing + 6 new)
- ✅ Test coverage includes:
  - Movement and game mechanics
  - Scoring systems
  - Validation logic
  - AI behavior
  - State management

### Documentation

- ✅ README.md for each game (10 files)
- ✅ GAMES.md catalog updated with all game entries
- ✅ TODO.md marked as complete
- ✅ All games properly exported in `paper_games/__init__.py`

### Integration

All games are:

- ✅ Runnable via `python -m paper_games.<game_name>`
- ✅ Importable from `paper_games` package
- ✅ Compatible with existing infrastructure:
  - `common/game_engine.py` - Base class
  - `common/analytics/` - Statistics tracking (ready to use)
  - `common/architecture/` - Save/load, replay, events (ready to use)

## File Structure

Each game follows the standard pattern:

```
paper_games/<game_name>/
├── __init__.py          # Package initialization, exports
├── __main__.py          # CLI entry point
├── <game_name>.py       # Core game logic and CLI
└── README.md            # Game documentation
```

## How to Use

### Run Any Game

```bash
python -m paper_games.snakes_and_ladders
python -m paper_games.yahtzee
python -m paper_games.mastermind
python -m paper_games.twenty_questions
python -m paper_games.boggle
python -m paper_games.four_square_writing
python -m paper_games.pentago
python -m paper_games.backgammon
python -m paper_games.sprouts
python -m paper_games.chess
```

### Import in Code

```python
from paper_games.snakes_and_ladders import SnakesAndLaddersGame
from paper_games.yahtzee import YahtzeeGame, YahtzeeCategory
from paper_games.mastermind import MastermindGame
from paper_games.boggle import BoggleGame
# ... etc
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/test_new_paper_games.py -v
```
