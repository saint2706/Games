"""Logic puzzle progression, hints, and analytics services.

This module centralizes gameplay progression for the logic games catalog. It
provides a framework for defining level packs, difficulty progression, and
unlock rules. The `LogicPuzzleService` is the main entry point, offering
functionality for tracking player progress, providing hints, and generating
leaderboards.

The service is designed to be framework-agnostic, allowing it to power both
command-line and graphical user interfaces. It integrates with the global
tutorial registry to provide contextual hints and tips.

Classes:
    PuzzleDifficulty: Configuration for a single puzzle difficulty level.
    LevelPack: A themed collection of puzzle difficulties.
    LogicPuzzleDefinition: The complete definition for a logic puzzle.
    LogicPuzzleService: A service to manage puzzle progression and analytics.

Factories:
    GameFactory: A callable that creates a game engine instance.
