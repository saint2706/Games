"""Bunco game engine.

This module provides the core logic for playing a game of Bunco, a social dice
game based on rounds. It includes the main game engine (`BuncoGame`) which
handles the rules of rolling dice and scoring, as well as a `BuncoTournament`
class to simulate a multi-round tournament.

Classes:
    BuncoPlayerSummary: Holds aggregate statistics for a player.
    BuncoMatchResult: Contains the details of a single match.
    BuncoGame: Manages the state and rules of a single Bunco game.
    BuncoTournament: Simulates a single-elimination tournament.
