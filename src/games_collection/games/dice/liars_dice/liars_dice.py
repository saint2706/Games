"""Liar's Dice game engine.

This module provides the core implementation of the Liar's Dice game, a classic
game of bluffing and statistical reasoning. Each player has a cup of dice, which
they roll and keep hidden from others. Players then take turns making bids on
the total number of dice of a certain face value across all players' hands.

The game proceeds with players either raising the bid or challenging the
previous bid. When a challenge occurs, the dice are revealed, and one player
loses a die. The last player with dice remaining wins.

Classes:
    LiarsDiceGame: The main engine for managing the game state and rules.

Functions:
    _liars_dice_move_heuristic: A heuristic function for AI decision-making.
