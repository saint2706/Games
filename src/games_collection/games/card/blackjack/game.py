"""Blackjack game engine and supporting data structures.

This module contains the core logic for a game of Blackjack, including the
rules for hands, player actions, and game progression. It is designed to be
reusable and adaptable for different interfaces, such as a command-line or
graphical user interface.

The main components are:
- ``Outcome``: An ``Enum`` representing the possible results of a hand.
- ``SideBetType``: An ``Enum`` for supported side bets like "21+3".
- ``TableRules``: A dataclass to configure table-specific rules.
- ``BlackjackHand``: A class that manages the cards in a hand, calculates totals,
  and checks for conditions like blackjack or bust.
- ``Shoe``: Represents a collection of multiple decks of cards, from which
  cards are drawn during the game, including card counting features.
- ``Player``: A dataclass for players, managing their bankroll and hands.
- ``BlackjackGame``: The main game engine that orchestrates the game flow,
  manages player and dealer actions, and resolves outcomes.
