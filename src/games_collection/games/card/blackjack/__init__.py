"""Blackjack game package.

This package provides the core engine for playing Blackjack, along with optional
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) built with Tkinter and PyQt5.

The main components are re-exported here to provide a simplified facade for
importing. This allows users to import core classes like ``BlackjackGame``
directly from ``games_collection.games.card.blackjack``.

Core Components:
- ``BlackjackGame``: The main game engine.
- ``BlackjackHand``: Represents a player's or dealer's hand.
- ``Outcome``: An enumeration of possible hand outcomes.

Optional GUI Components:
- ``BlackjackApp`` (Tkinter): A simple Tkinter-based GUI for the game.
- ``BlackjackTable`` (PyQt5): A more advanced PyQt5-based GUI.
