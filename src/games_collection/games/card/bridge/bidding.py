"""Bidding helper for Contract Bridge, with support for standard conventions.

This module implements an auction assistant that understands a handful of
standard bidding conventions. The ``BiddingHelper`` collaborates with the core
``BridgeGame`` object to enumerate legal calls, apply conventions like Stayman
and Jacoby transfers, and make informed decisions about penalty doubles.

The goal is to produce sensible, explainable calls that can be integrated
with both command-line and graphical user interfaces.
