"""General representations of playing cards shared across games.

This module provides fundamental data structures for representing playing cards,
suits, and decks. These components are designed to be reusable across various
card games. The module includes:

- ``Suit``: An ``Enum`` for the four card suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades).
- ``RANKS``: A tuple defining the order of card ranks from '2' to 'A'.
- ``RANK_TO_VALUE``: A dictionary mapping each rank to a numerical value.
- ``Card``: A dataclass representing a single playing card with a rank and suit.
- ``Deck``: A class for a deck of cards, with methods for shuffling and dealing.
- ``parse_card``: A function to create a ``Card`` from a two-character string (e.g., "KH" for King of Hearts).
- ``format_cards``: A utility function to format a collection of cards into a readable string.

Examples:
    >>> deck = Deck()
    >>> deck.shuffle()
    >>> hand = deck.deal(5)
    >>> print(format_cards(hand))
    K♠ Q♥ J♦ T♣ 9♥
