# Poker Enhancements Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the poker module as specified in the requirements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Omaha Hold'em Variant ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Added `GameVariant` enum with `TEXAS_HOLDEM` and `OMAHA` options
- Modified `PokerTable.start_hand()` to deal 4 hole cards for Omaha (vs 2 for Texas Hold'em)
- Implemented `PokerTable._evaluate_hand()` method that enforces Omaha hand rules:
  - Must use exactly 2 hole cards and 3 community cards
  - Evaluates all possible combinations to find the best hand
- Updated CLI argument parser with `--variant` option

**Usage:**

```bash
python -m games_collection.games.card.poker --variant omaha
```

**Testing:**

- Verified 4 hole cards are dealt to each player
- Confirmed hand evaluation uses exactly 2+3 card combinations
- Tested showdown scenarios with proper Omaha rules

### 2. Tournament Mode with Increasing Blinds ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `TournamentMode` dataclass with configurable blind schedule
- Default schedule: [(10,20), (15,30), (25,50), (50,100), (100,200)]
- Blinds increase every 5 hands by default (configurable)
- Integrated blind updates into `PokerMatch.play_cli()`
- Added blind level display in both CLI and GUI

**Usage:**

```bash
python -m games_collection.games.card.poker --tournament --rounds 10
```

**Features:**

- Automatic blind increases based on hand number
- Visual notification when blinds increase
- Blind level displayed in GUI header
- Current blinds shown at start of each hand in CLI

### 3. Showdown Animation in GUI ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Added `_animate_showdown()` method to GUI
- Sequential card reveals with timing delays
- Hand category display during evaluation
- Winner highlighting after showdown completes

**Features:**

- Cards revealed with 300ms delay per player
- Hand ranking categories displayed during evaluation
- Winner names announced after evaluation
- Visual feedback for showdown progression

### 4. Pot-Limit and No-Limit Betting Options ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Added `BettingLimit` enum with `NO_LIMIT`, `POT_LIMIT`, and `FIXED_LIMIT` options
- Modified `PokerTable.apply_action()` to enforce pot-limit restrictions:
  - Bet limit: current_bet + pot size
  - Raise limit: pot + amount_to_call + current_bet
- Added `--limit` CLI argument

**Usage:**

```bash
python -m games_collection.games.card.poker --limit pot-limit
```

**Enforcement:**

- No-limit: No restrictions (default)
- Pot-limit: Bets/raises capped at pot size
- Fixed-limit: Structure in place for future implementation

### 5. Player Statistics Tracking ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `PlayerStatistics` dataclass tracking:
  - Hands played / won / folded
  - Total wagered / winnings
  - Showdowns reached / won
  - Calculated metrics: fold frequency, win rate, net profit
- Statistics updated after each hand
- Integrated into both `Player` class and match flow

**Features:**

- Real-time statistics tracking during play
- Summary display at match end in CLI
- Final statistics shown in GUI log
- Per-player breakdown of performance

**Display Format:**

```
You:
  Hands played: 10
  Hands won: 3 (30.0%)
  Hands folded: 5 (50.0%)
  Showdowns: 2/4
  Net profit: +150 chips
```

### 6. Hand History Log ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `HandHistory` dataclass to record:
  - Hand number and timestamp
  - Game variant and blind levels
  - Player chip counts and hole cards
  - Community cards and all actions
  - Showdown results and payouts
- Automatic JSON export after each match
- Filename format: `poker_history_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

**Usage:** History files are automatically saved in the working directory after each match.

**JSON Structure:**

```json
{
  "game_variant": "omaha",
  "betting_limit": "pot-limit",
  "tournament_mode": true,
  "hands": [
    {
      "hand_number": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-10T20:28:13.555240",
      "players": { ... },
      "hole_cards": { ... },
      "community_cards": [ ... ],
      "actions": [ ... ],
      "showdown": [ ... ],
      "payouts": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "final_statistics": { ... }
}
```

## Command-Line Options

### 7. Parallel Monte Carlo Equity Estimation ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Extracted the Monte Carlo loop into a worker-friendly helper so batches can be dispatched to `ProcessPoolExecutor` workers.
- Added a `max_workers` setting to each `BotSkill` profile to control parallelism without new configuration surfaces.
- The estimator automatically falls back to serial execution when only a single CPU core is available or when process pools are unavailable.

**Usage:**

- Configure the AI profile you launch with to tune simulation volume **and** worker count:

  ```python
  from games_collection.games.card.poker import DIFFICULTIES

  hard_skill = DIFFICULTIES["Hard"]
  print(hard_skill.simulations, hard_skill.max_workers)
  ```

- Override `max_workers` at runtime when constructing a custom `BotSkill` if you need different concurrency characteristics.

**Testing & Benchmarks:**

- Regression tests compare serial and parallel equity results to guarantee deterministic outcomes with seeded RNGs.
- Benchmark tests assert a measurable speed-up when multiple CPU cores are present; they are skipped automatically on single-core systems.

All new features are accessible via CLI arguments:

```bash
# Full feature showcase
python -m games_collection.games.card.poker \
  --variant omaha \
  --limit pot-limit \
  --tournament \
  --rounds 10 \
  --difficulty Medium

# GUI with tournament mode
python -m games_collection.games.card.poker --gui --tournament

# Omaha with pot-limit
python -m games_collection.games.card.poker --variant omaha --limit pot-limit
```

## Testing Results

All features have been tested with the following scenarios:

1. **Omaha Variant**: Verified 4-card dealing and proper hand evaluation
1. **Tournament Mode**: Confirmed blind increases at correct intervals
1. **Pot-Limit Betting**: Tested bet size restrictions
1. **Statistics**: Validated tracking across multiple hands
1. **Hand History**: Confirmed JSON export with complete game data
1. **Combined Features**: Tested all features working together

## Code Quality

- **Formatting**: Code formatted with Black (line length: 160)
- **Linting**: Passed Ruff checks with no issues
- **Type Safety**: All new code includes type hints
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all new classes and methods

## Files Modified

1. `src/games_collection/games/card/poker/poker.py` - Core engine enhancements
1. `src/games_collection/games/card/poker/gui.py` - GUI updates for new features
1. `README.md` - Updated documentation
1. `TODO.md` - Marked completed tasks
1. `.gitignore` - Added poker history file exclusion

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backwards compatible with existing code.

## Future Enhancements

While all required features are implemented, potential improvements include:

- Fixed-limit betting enforcement
- More detailed showdown animations
- Hand history replay feature
- Configurable tournament blind schedules
- Multi-table tournament support
