"""Engine, bot AI, and CLI utilities for a Texas Hold'em poker experience.

This module provides a comprehensive implementation of Texas Hold'em, including
the game engine, a configurable bot AI, and a command-line interface. The code
is structured to be readable and educational, with detailed docstrings
explaining the rules and logic at each step.

Key Components:
- **Action**: Represents player decisions like 'bet', 'call', and 'fold'.
- **Player**: Manages a player's state, including chips and cards.
- **PokerBot**: An AI opponent with customizable skill and personality traits.
- **PokerTable**: Orchestrates a single hand of poker, from dealing to showdown.
- **PokerMatch**: Manages a full match, including multiple hands and scoring.
