"""Hearts card game engine.

This module implements the classic trick-taking card game Hearts, where the
primary goal is to avoid taking penalty cards (all hearts and the Queen of
Spades). A player who successfully "shoots the moon" by taking all penalty
cards can instead give points to all other players.

Key Features:
- A rotating card passing phase (left, right, across, none).
- Trick-taking gameplay with standard follow-suit rules.
- Detection and scoring for "shooting the moon."
- A basic AI that attempts to avoid taking penalty points.
