# Anagrams

Anagrams is a word puzzle game where the player unscrambles letters to form a meaningful word. This version is a simple, single-player game that tests your vocabulary and anagram-solving skills over a series of rounds.

## Gameplay

The game presents you with a scrambled word, and your goal is to guess the original, unscrambled word. The game proceeds in a fixed number of rounds (5 by default). In each round, a new scrambled word is provided.

The game ends when all rounds have been completed. Your final score is the total number of words you successfully unscrambled.

## Running the Game

To play the game, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
python -m games_collection.games.word.anagrams
```

This will start the command-line interface for the game.
