# Snakes and Ladders

A classic board game where players race to the finish by rolling dice, climbing ladders, and avoiding snakes.

**Gameplay**:

1. Players take turns rolling a single die (1-6)

1. If you land on a ladder, climb up to the top
1. If you land on a snake's head, slide down to its tail
1. First player to reach or pass the final square wins

```bash
python -m games_collection.games.paper.snakes_and_ladders
