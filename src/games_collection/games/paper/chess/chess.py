"""A basic stub for a full Chess game implementation.

This module serves as a placeholder for a complete Chess game engine. A full
implementation would include a robust set of features to accurately model the
game of Chess, including:

- **Complete Rule Set**: Implementation of all piece movement rules, including
  special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- **Game State Management**: Accurate detection of check, checkmate, and
  stalemate conditions.
- **AI Opponent**: A challenging AI, likely using a sophisticated algorithm
  like minimax with alpha-beta pruning or a neural network-based approach.
- **Move Validation**: A comprehensive system for validating player moves
  against the rules of the game.

The current implementation is a simplified version with only pawn movement
to serve as a foundation for future development.

Classes:
    ChessGame: A basic game engine for Chess with simplified rules.
    ChessCLI: A command-line interface for the placeholder Chess game.
