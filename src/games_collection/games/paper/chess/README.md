# Chess

This module serves as a foundational stub for a complete and feature-rich Chess game implementation. The goal is to develop a comprehensive chess engine with a challenging AI and a clean interface.

## Planned Features

A full implementation of this Chess game will include:

- **Complete Piece Movement**: Accurate implementation of all standard piece movements, including pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, the queen, and the king.
- **Special Moves**: Full support for special chess moves, including:
  - **Castling**: Both kingside and queenside.
  - **En Passant**: Capturing a pawn that has just made a two-square advance.
  - **Pawn Promotion**: Promoting a pawn to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight upon reaching the opposite end of the board.
- **Game State Detection**: Robust logic for detecting critical game states:
  - **Check**: When a king is under immediate attack.
  - **Checkmate**: When a king is in check and there is no legal move to escape.
  - **Stalemate**: When a player is not in check but has no legal moves.
- **AI Opponent**: A challenging AI powered by a sophisticated algorithm, such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning or a more advanced neural network-based approach.
- **Standard Notation**: The ability to use and understand standard algebraic notation for moves (e.g., "e4", "Nf3").

## Current State

The current implementation is a **basic placeholder** designed to establish the project structure. It includes:
- A simplified board with only pawns.
- A basic move function that only allows pawns to move one step forward.

This stub serves as a starting point for building out the full set of features described above.
