"""Game engine and logic for Battleship with a hunting AI opponent.

This module provides the core game logic for Battleship, including ship placement,
shot validation, and an AI opponent that uses a "hunt and target" strategy to
find and sink ships efficiently. It supports various board sizes, fleet
configurations, and game modes like salvo mode.

The main classes in this module are:
- `Ship`: Represents a single ship with its name, length, and hit status.
- `Board`: Manages the game board, including ship placement, shot tracking,
  and rendering.
- `BattleshipGame`: Orchestrates the entire game, managing the player and
  opponent boards, AI logic, and game state.

The AI's strategy involves:
1. **Hunting**: Systematically checking coordinates (e.g., in a checkerboard
   pattern) to find a ship.
2. **Targeting**: Once a hit is registered, creating a queue of adjacent
   coordinates to explore and sink the ship.
