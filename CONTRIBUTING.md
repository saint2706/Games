# Contributing to the Games Collection

The canonical contribution guide now lives in the Sphinx documentation so every policy is maintained in one place.

Read the latest instructions at [docs/source/contributors/contributing.rst](docs/source/contributors/contributing.rst) or build the HTML site and open `docs/build/html/contributors/index.html`.

When submitting changes, please ensure tests pass and update the relevant Sphinx pages instead of editing Markdown duplicates.
