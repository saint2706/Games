"""Command-line interface for the Blackjack game.

This module provides the necessary functions to run a game of Blackjack in the
terminal. It handles command-line argument parsing, user input prompts, and
rendering the game state to the console. The main entry point is the `main`
function, which initializes the game and starts the game loop.

Key Features:
- Argument parsing for bankroll, minimum bet, number of decks, and random seed.
- Educational mode with card counting hints.
- Interactive prompts for bets, side bets, and player actions.
- Clear rendering of the game table, including hands and card counting info.
