# Hearts

Trick-taking card game where the goal is to avoid taking hearts and the Queen of Spades, or to "shoot the moon" by taking all penalty cards.

## How to Play

```bash
python -m card_games.hearts
```

## Game Rules

- Four players compete individually
- Each player is dealt 13 cards
- Before each hand, players pass 3 cards in rotating directions (left, right, across, none)
- Players must follow suit if possible
- Opening trick must start with the 2â™£ and cannot contain penalty cards unless unavoidable
- Hearts may not be led until they are "broken" by a heart discard or the queen of spades
- Hearts and the Queen of Spades are penalty cards (1 and 13 points respectively)
- **Shooting the Moon**: Taking all hearts AND the Queen of Spades gives 0 points to you and 26 to everyone else
- **Shooting the Sun**: Winning every trick in a hand is recorded as a special achievement
- First player to reach 100 points loses

## Features

- Pass-the-cards mechanic with rotating directions and historical tracking
- Strict opening-trick rule enforcement and automatic heart-breaking logic
- Trick history and round summaries, including moon/sun achievements
