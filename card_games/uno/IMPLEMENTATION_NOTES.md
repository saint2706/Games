# Uno Game - Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document provides technical implementation notes for the Uno game features that were requested in the TODO.md file.

## Feature Implementation Status

### ✅ House Rules Options (Partial)

#### Stacking (Fully Implemented)
- **Status**: Complete and tested
- **Implementation**: 
  - Logic in `uno.py` methods `_execute_play()` and `_accept_penalty()`
  - Allows players to stack +2 and +4 cards
  - Penalty accumulates until a player accepts or the chain breaks
- **Testing**: Verified with `test_uno_features.py`
- **Usage**: `--stacking` flag

#### 7-0 Swapping (Fully Implemented)
- **Status**: Complete and tested
- **Implementation**:
  - Hand swapping for 7 cards: `_swap_hands()` method
  - Hand rotation for 0 cards: `_rotate_hands()` method
  - Integrated into `_execute_play()` with sound effects
- **Testing**: Verified with `test_uno_features.py`
- **Usage**: `--seven-zero` flag

#### Jump-In (Not Implemented)
- **Status**: Flag exists, game logic not implemented
- **Implementation**: Command-line argument parsing exists
- **Reason**: Requires significant changes to turn flow:
  1. After each card play, need to check all other players
  2. Prompt each player if they have an identical card
  3. Handle simultaneous jump-in attempts
  4. Manage turn order interruption
  5. Update both console and GUI interfaces
- **TODO**: Marked with comment in `HouseRules` dataclass
- **Future Work**: Would require refactoring the main game loop in `play()` method

### ✅ 2v2 Team Play Mode (Fully Implemented)
- **Status**: Complete and tested
- **Implementation**:
  - Team assignment in `build_players()` function
  - Team validation in `UnoGame.__init__()`
  - Team victory detection in `_execute_play()`
  - Teams assigned as Player 0/2 vs Player 1/3
- **Testing**: Verified with `test_uno_features.py`
- **Usage**: `--team-mode` flag (requires exactly 4 players)
- **File**: `uno.py` lines 968-1022

### ✅ Card Animation Effects in GUI (Enhanced)
- **Status**: Basic implementation enhanced
- **Implementation**:
  - Method: `_animate_card_play()` in `gui.py`
  - Features:
    - Gold highlight (#FFD700) on played card
    - Pulsing effect (6 animation steps)
    - Relief style changes (raised/flat)
    - 80ms timing per step
    - Non-blocking execution
- **Extensibility**: Method can be further enhanced with:
  - Canvas-based sliding animations
  - Card rotation effects
  - Position-based transitions
  - Fade-in/fade-out effects
- **File**: `gui.py` lines 444-471

### ✅ Sound Effects (Fully Implemented)
- **Status**: Complete infrastructure, optional pygame dependency
- **Implementation**:
  - New module: `sound_manager.py`
  - Class: `SoundManager` with pygame.mixer integration
  - Factory function: `create_sound_manager()`
  - Integration: GUI uses sound manager in `play_sound()` method
  - Graceful degradation: Works without pygame installed
- **Sound Types Supported**:
  - `card_play` - Regular card placement
  - `wild` - Wild card
  - `skip` - Skip card
  - `reverse` - Reverse card
  - `draw_penalty` - +2 or +4 card
  - `uno` - UNO declaration
  - `win` - Game victory
  - `swap` - Hand swap (7 card)
  - `rotate` - Hand rotation (0 card)
  - `draw` - Card drawn from deck
- **Sound Hooks**: Already integrated throughout game logic in `uno.py`
- **Dependencies**: Optional pygame installation (`pip install pygame`)
- **Directory**: `sounds/` with README.md for user guidance
- **Files**: 
  - `sound_manager.py` (new)
  - `gui.py` (modified)
  - `sounds/README.md` (new)

### ❌ Online Multiplayer Capability (Not Implemented)
- **Status**: Guide exists, implementation not done
- **Reason**: Out of scope for minimal changes requirement
- **Requirements**:
  - WebSocket server implementation
  - Client-side networking code
  - Game state synchronization
  - Player authentication system
  - Lobby and matchmaking
  - Real-time communication
  - Spectator mode
  - Chat functionality
- **Reference**: See `MULTIPLAYER_GUIDE.md` for architecture
- **Estimated Effort**: Multiple weeks of development
- **Decision**: Marked as future enhancement

### ❌ Custom Deck Designer (Not Implemented)
- **Status**: Guide exists, implementation not done
- **Reason**: Out of scope for minimal changes requirement
- **Requirements**:
  - Extended UnoCard class with custom effects
  - CustomDeckLoader class
  - JSON schema for deck definitions
  - Deck validation logic
  - Custom effect handlers
  - Integration with game engine
  - CLI tool for deck creation
- **Reference**: See `CUSTOM_DECK_GUIDE.md` for implementation guide
- **Estimated Effort**: Several weeks of development
- **Decision**: Marked as future enhancement

## Architecture Decisions

### Conditional GUI Import
**Problem**: The uno package import failed when tkinter was not available (e.g., in headless environments or during testing).

**Solution**: Modified `__init__.py` to conditionally import GUI components:
```python
try:
    from .gui import TkUnoInterface, launch_uno_gui
    __all__.extend(["TkUnoInterface", "launch_uno_gui"])
except ImportError:
    pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Tests can run without tkinter
- Console mode works in headless environments
- GUI components only loaded when available

### Sound Manager Design
**Pattern**: Factory pattern with graceful degradation

**Key Features**:
1. **Optional Dependency**: pygame not required for game to work
2. **Silent Failure**: Missing sound files don't crash the game
3. **Simple Interface**: Single `play()` method for all sounds
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new sound types

**Implementation Details**:
```python
PYGAME_AVAILABLE = True/False  # Module-level flag
SoundManager.enabled  # Instance-level flag
```

### Animation Design
**Pattern**: Closure-based recursive animation

**Key Features**:
1. **Non-blocking**: Uses `root.after()` for timing
2. **Self-contained**: Animation state in closure
3. **Cancellable**: Can be interrupted naturally
4. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust timing and effects

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Core game logic (cards, players, rules)
- **Integration Tests**: Feature interactions (team mode with house rules)
- **Mock Objects**: UI independence for testing

### Test File: `tests/test_uno_features.py`
- Tests for HouseRules configuration
- Tests for team mode player assignment
- Tests for stacking functionality
- Tests for 7-0 swap/rotate mechanics
- Tests for card matching logic

### Running Tests
```bash
python tests/test_uno_features.py
```

All tests pass successfully as of this implementation.
