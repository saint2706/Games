"""Utility for evaluating and describing poker hands from concise card codes.

This module provides a convenient command-line tool for quickly evaluating poker
hands. It uses a two-character code for each card (e.g., "AS" for Ace of Spades)
and prints a human-friendly description of the hand's rank.

Example Usage:
    python -m card_games.poker.poker_hand_evaluator AS KD QH JC TC
    # Output: Straight (A♠ K♦ Q♥ J♣ T♣)
