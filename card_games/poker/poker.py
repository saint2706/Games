"""Engine, bot AI, and CLI utilities for a Texas Hold'em poker experience.

The module mirrors the structure of a real-world poker room and documents the
reasoning for each rule directly beside the implementation. By reading the
docstrings and comments, newcomers can follow the flow from high-level match
management down to the evaluation of individual five-card hands.

Key components:

* :class:`ActionType` and :class:`Action` encode the discrete decisions players
  can make during a betting round.
* :class:`Player` stores the mutable state of a participant, including their
  chip stack, hole cards, and recent betting history.
* :class:`BotSkill` and :class:`PokerBot` parameterise the behaviour of computer
  opponents, explaining how aggression, bluff frequency, and mistake rate
  influence their choices.
* :class:`PokerTable` models a single hand, coordinating blinds, betting rounds,
  and pot distribution with extensive inline commentary for each stage.
* :class:`PokerMatch` strings multiple hands together to form a short match that
  pits the user against three bot opponents.
* :func:`estimate_win_rate` demonstrates how Monte Carlo simulation can be used
  to approximate pre-flop equity.

Together with :mod:`card_games.poker.gui`, these components provide both a
playable experience and richly annotated sample code for anyone studying the
mechanics of poker software.
