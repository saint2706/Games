"""Cribbage card game engine.

This module implements the classic two-player Cribbage card game, featuring:
- The Deal: Each player gets 6 cards, discards 2 to the crib
- The Play (Pegging): Players alternate playing cards, scoring for pairs, runs, and 15s
- The Show: Both hands and the crib are scored for combinations
- First to 121 points wins

Rules:
* Standard 52-card deck
* Cards score: Ace=1, 2-10=face value, J/Q/K=10
* During play, score for reaching 15 (2 points), pairs (2 points), runs (length points)
* Cannot exceed 31 during play
* The Show scores: 15s (2 each), pairs (2 each), runs (length), flush (4-5), nobs (1)
