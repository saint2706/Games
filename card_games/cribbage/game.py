"""Cribbage card game engine.

This module implements the classic two-player Cribbage card game, featuring:
- The Deal: Each player gets 6 cards and discards 2 to the crib.
- The Play (Pegging): Players alternate playing cards, scoring for pairs, runs, and 15s.
- The Show: Both hands and the crib are scored for combinations.
- The first player to reach 121 points wins.

Core Rules:
- A standard 52-card deck is used.
- Card values for pegging: Ace=1, 2-10=face value, J/Q/K=10.
- Pegging scores: 15s (2 points), pairs (2 points), runs (1 point per card).
- The count during pegging cannot exceed 31.
- "The Show" scores: 15s (2 points), pairs (2 points), runs, flushes, and "nobs."
