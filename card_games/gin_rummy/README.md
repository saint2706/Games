# Gin Rummy

The Gin Rummy module now simulates full-length matches with authentic rules:

- Alternating dealers with an opening upcard offer that each player may accept or pass.
- Exhaustive meld search to minimise deadwood and surface the exact sets/runs a player can table.
- Realistic scoring that distinguishes normal knocks, gin, big gin, and undercuts while processing opponent layoffs.
- Automatic stock reshuffles, discard restrictions (no throwing back the taken upcard), and a persistent round log.
- A smarter AI capable of evaluating draw sources, timing safe knocks, and discarding cards that hinder meld formation.

## Running the CLI

Launch the interactive experience with:

```bash
python -m card_games.gin_rummy
```

During play you will see your hand analysis, available melds, and live scoring updates after every hand. The AI follows the same rules and will attempt to capitalise on gin or undercuts when the odds favour those plays.

## Graphical Interface

Prefer a point-and-click experience? Start the Tkinter GUI with:

```bash
python -m card_games.gin_rummy --mode gui [--player-name YOUR_NAME] [--opponent-name RIVAL]
```

The window displays score badges for both players, current deadwood counts, and a live meld analysis generated by
`GinRummyGame.analyze_hand()`. The round log at the bottom mirrors the engine's turn history so you can retrace every draw and
discard.

### Controls

- **Take/Pass Upcard** – resolve the opening offer before normal turns begin.
- **Draw Stock / Draw Discard** – enabled when it is your draw phase; the discard button is automatically disabled if the rules
  forbid drawing the face-up card.
- **Knock / Gin** – lights up once your deadwood is 10 or fewer (the label switches to *Declare Gin* when you are deadwood-free).
- **Discard Selected** – click a card in your hand to highlight it, then confirm the discard.
- **Start Next Round** – becomes available after the summary is shown.

Keyboard shortcuts mirror the primary controls: press **S** to draw from the stock, **D** to take the discard pile's top card, and
**K** (or **G**) to knock or declare gin. Status badges above each player panel indicate who must act next, while the status bar
summarises what the engine expects from you (draw, discard, or wait).

## Core Rules Implemented

- Two players receive 10 cards; the dealer alternates each round.
- The non-dealer may take the turned-up discard. If both players pass, that card cannot be taken until after the first stock draw.
- Melds include three- or four-of-a-kind sets and same-suit runs of length ≥ 3. The engine automatically finds the configuration that minimises deadwood.
- Players may knock with 10 or fewer deadwood points. Zero deadwood after drawing is scored as gin, or big gin when holding 11 cards.
- When a player knocks without gin, the opponent may lay off cards that extend the revealed melds before their deadwood is counted.
- Games continue until a player reaches 100 points.

### Scoring Details

| Event | Points Awarded |
|--------------|----------------|
| Knock | Deadwood difference (opponent minus knocker) |
| Gin | Opponent deadwood + 25 bonus points |
| Big Gin | Opponent deadwood + 31 bonus points |
| Undercut | Deadwood difference + 25 points to the undercutter |

## Testing

Run the focused test suite with:

```bash
pytest tests/test_new_card_games.py::TestGinRummy -q
```

These tests cover meld discovery, deadwood optimisation, scoring outcomes (including layoffs and undercuts), and deck recycling behaviour.
