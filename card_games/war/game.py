"""War card game engine.

This module implements the classic card game War, where two players each have
half the deck and simultaneously reveal cards. The player with the higher card
wins both cards. When cards are equal, a "war" occurs where players place
additional cards face down and then reveal another card.

Rules:
* Standard 52-card deck divided equally between 2 players
* Each round, both players reveal their top card
* Higher card wins both cards (Ace is highest)
* On a tie, players enter "war": place 3 cards face down, then 1 face up
* Winner of war takes all cards in play
* Game ends when one player has all cards or cannot participate in a war
