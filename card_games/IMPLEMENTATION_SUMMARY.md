# Card Games Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the new card games and features implemented to address the comprehensive card games
implementation issue.

## New Card Games Implemented

python -m card_games.crazy_eights
python -m card_games.crazy_eights --players 4
python -m card_games.crazy_eights --draw-limit 5
python -m card_games.crazy_eights --draw-limit 0  # unlimited
python -m card_games.crazy_eights --seed 42
```

**Architecture**:

- `game.py` - Core game engine with Player class
- `cli.py` - CLI with playability indicators
- `__main__.py` - Entry point
- `README.md` - Documentation

## New Cross-Game Features

### Universal Statistics System for Card Games

**Location**: `card_games/common/stats.py`

**Description**: Simplified wrapper around the existing `common/analytics/game_stats.py` system, specifically tailored
for card games.

**Features**:

- Win/loss/draw tracking per player
- Game duration tracking
- Win streaks and longest win streaks
- Leaderboards sorted by wins and win rate
- Persistent storage (saved to disk)
- Easy integration with any card game
- Optional score tracking

**Integration Example** (War game):

```python
from card_games.common.stats import CardGameStats

stats = CardGameStats("war")
stats.record_win("Player 1", duration=120.5)
stats.record_loss("Player 2", duration=120.5)
stats.save()

# Display stats
stats.display_player_stats("Player 1")
stats.display_leaderboard()
```

**Command-line Integration**:

```bash
# Play with stats tracking (enabled by default)
python -m card_games.war

# Disable stats
python -m card_games.war --no-stats

# View leaderboard
python -m card_games.war --leaderboard

# View player stats
python -m card_games.war --show-stats --player "Player 1"
```

**Benefits**:

- Encourages replayability
- Tracks player progress over time
- Provides competitive element with leaderboards
- Easy to integrate into existing and future card games

## Architecture Patterns Followed

All implemented games follow the repository's established architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:

   - `game.py` - Pure game logic, no UI dependencies
   - `cli.py` - Command-line interface
   - `__main__.py` - Entry point with argument parsing
   - `README.md` - Documentation

1. **Code Quality**:

   - Type hints on all functions
   - Google-style docstrings
   - Black formatting (160 char line length)
   - Ruff linting compliance
   - Complexity kept under control

1. **Testing-Friendly**:

   - Deterministic gameplay with seed support
   - Pure functions for game logic
   - Easy to unit test

1. **Consistent CLI Patterns**:

   - `--seed` for reproducible games
   - `--players` for multiplayer configuration
   - `--names` for custom player names
   - `--help` for usage information

______________________________________________________________________

## Testing

All games have been manually tested:

- **War**: Tested with various seeds, auto-play mode works correctly
- **Go Fish**: Tested with 2-6 players, book detection works
- **Crazy Eights**: Tested with various player counts and draw limits
- **Statistics**: Tested persistence and retrieval

Example test commands:

```bash
# War with seed
python -m card_games.war --auto --seed 42 --delay 0

# Go Fish with multiple players
python -m card_games.go_fish --players 4 --seed 123

# Crazy Eights with draw limit
python -m card_games.crazy_eights --players 3 --draw-limit 0 --seed 456
```

| War game | ~230 |
| Go Fish game | ~320 |
| Crazy Eights game | ~315 |
| Statistics wrapper | ~230 |
| **Total** | **~1,095** |

- Euchre - Trump-based trick-taking
- Rummy 500 - Melding variant
- Canasta - Wild cards, partnerships (Low Priority)
- Pinochle - Double-deck, bidding (Low Priority)

### Uno Features

- Jump-in rule completion (requires major refactoring)
- Online multiplayer (out of scope per documentation)
- Custom deck designer (out of scope per documentation)

### Additional Cross-Game Features

- GUI implementations for new games (using existing BaseGUI)
- Save/load game state integration
- Replay/undo functionality integration
- Event-driven architecture integration
- AI opponents for single-player games
- Achievement system
- Profile/progression system

## Integration Guide for Future Games

To add statistics tracking to a new card game:

1. Import the stats module:

```python
from card_games.common.stats import CardGameStats
```

2. Create stats tracker:

```python
stats = CardGameStats("your_game_name")
```

3. Record game results:

```python
stats.record_win("Player 1", duration=game_duration, score=final_score)
stats.record_loss("Player 2", duration=game_duration, score=final_score)
stats.save()
```

4. Add CLI arguments for stats display:

```python
parser.add_argument("--show-stats", action="store_true")
parser.add_argument("--leaderboard", action="store_true")
parser.add_argument("--no-stats", action="store_true")
```

5. Handle stats display:

```python
if args.show_stats:
    stats.display_player_stats(player_name)
if args.leaderboard:
    stats.display_leaderboard()
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides:

- **3 new playable card games** with complete rules and features
- **Universal statistics system** that can be easily integrated into all card games
- **Consistent patterns** that make it easy to add more games
- **High-quality code** following repository standards
- **Comprehensive documentation** for users and developers

These games demonstrate the patterns that can be followed for implementing the remaining card games on the TODO list.
Each game took approximately 300-400 lines of code and a few hours to implement, suggesting that the remaining 5 card
games could be completed following the same patterns.
