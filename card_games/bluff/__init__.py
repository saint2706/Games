"""Bluff (Cheat) card game engine and user interfaces.

This module acts as the public API surface for the Bluff package. Importing it
exposes the key classes and helpers required to embed the engine in other
applications and highlights the available user interfaces (CLI and GUI) without
needing to dig into the implementation modules.
