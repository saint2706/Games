"""Euchre card game engine.

This module implements the classic four-player Euchre game with trump-based
trick-taking gameplay and the unique "going alone" mechanic.

Rules:
* 24-card deck (9, T, J, Q, K, A of each suit)
* Four players in two partnerships (1&3 vs 2&4)
* Trump suit selected after dealing
* Right bower (Jack of trump) is highest trump
* Left bower (Jack of same-color suit) is second highest trump
* First team to 10 points wins
* "Going alone" option for maker's partner to sit out
