"""Go Fish card game engine.

This module implements the classic card game Go Fish, where players try to
collect sets of four cards of the same rank ("books") by asking opponents for
specific cards.

Key Rules:
- 2-6 players.
- 5 cards are dealt to each player (7 if there are 2 players).
- Players take turns asking an opponent for cards of a specific rank.
- If the opponent has the requested rank, they must give all cards of that rank.
- If not, the asking player must "Go Fish" by drawing from the deck.
- When a player collects a set of 4, they lay it down as a "book" and score a point.
- The game ends when all 13 books have been made.
