# Enhanced Features Applied to Games

This document summarizes the infrastructure enhancements that have been applied to demonstrate the capabilities of the common architecture systems.

## Overview

Three games have been enhanced to demonstrate different infrastructure capabilities:

1. **War (Card Game)** - Save/Load Functionality
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe (Paper Game)** - Replay/Undo Functionality
1. **Hangman (Paper Game)** - CLI Enhancements

## 1. War Game - Save/Load Functionality

### Changes Made

**File: `card_games/war/game.py`**

- Added `to_dict()` method to serialize game state
- Added `from_dict()` class method to deserialize and restore game state
- Serializes all game components: player decks, pile, state, rounds, wars, winner

**File: `card_games/war/gui.py`**

- Integrated `SaveLoadManager` from `common.architecture.persistence`
- Added "Save Game" button to GUI
- Added "Load Game" button to GUI
- Implemented `_save_game()` handler with file dialog
- Implemented `_load_game()` handler with file selection

### Usage

Players can now:

- Save their game progress at any time during play
- Load previously saved games to continue from where they left off
- Games are saved with metadata (timestamp, game type)
- Save files are stored in `./saves/` directory

### Testing

```bash
python -m card_games.war --gui
# Click "Save Game" during gameplay
# Click "Load Game" to restore a saved game
```

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe - Replay/Undo Functionality

### Changes Made

**File: `paper_games/tic_tac_toe/tic_tac_toe.py`**

- Integrated `ReplayManager` from `common.architecture.replay`
- Added replay manager initialization in `__post_init__()`
- Modified `make_move()` to record actions with state snapshots
- Added `undo_last_move()` method to undo moves
- Added `can_undo()` method to check if undo is available

**File: `paper_games/tic_tac_toe/cli.py`**

- Added 'undo' command support in the game loop
- Undoing reverts both the human's last move and the computer's previous move
- Automatically switches turn back after undo

### Usage

During gameplay:

- Type `undo` instead of a move coordinate
- The game will undo your last move and the computer's previous move
- The board state is fully restored from the snapshot
- Continue playing from the restored position

### Testing

```bash
python -m paper_games.tic_tac_toe
# Make some moves
# Type "undo" to revert moves
```

## 3. Hangman - CLI Enhancements

### Changes Made

**File: `paper_games/hangman/cli.py`**

- Integrated `ASCIIArt`, `InteractiveMenu`, `RichText`, `Theme` from `common.cli_utils`
- Created `CLI_THEME` for consistent color scheme
- Replaced plain text menus with `InteractiveMenu` (supports arrow key navigation)
- Added ASCII art banner for welcome screen
- Added ASCII art banner for multiplayer mode
- Applied `RichText` for all user feedback:
  - Success messages (green)
  - Error messages (red)
  - Info messages (blue)
  - Warning messages (yellow)
  - Highlighted messages (gold)
- Added `clear_screen()` for better UX

### Usage

Enhanced user experience:

- **Interactive Menus**: Use arrow keys (↑↓) and Enter to select options
- **Colored Output**: Success, error, info, and warning messages are color-coded
- **ASCII Art**: Welcome banner and section headers
- **Clear Screen**: Better visual organization between screens

### Testing

```bash
python -m paper_games.hangman
# Navigate menus with arrow keys
# See colored feedback during gameplay
```

## Architecture Systems Demonstrated

### 1. Persistence System (`common/architecture/persistence.py`)

- `SaveLoadManager` - High-level save/load interface
- `JSONSerializer` - JSON-based serialization (used by default)
- Automatic metadata handling (timestamps, game type)
- Directory management for save files

### 2. Replay System (`common/architecture/replay.py`)

- `ReplayManager` - Undo/redo functionality
- `ReplayAction` - Action recording with state snapshots
- History management with configurable limits
- State restoration from snapshots

### 3. CLI Utilities (`common/cli_utils.py`)

- `InteractiveMenu` - Arrow key navigation menus
- `ASCIIArt` - Banner and box creation
- `RichText` - Colored text output (success, error, info, warning, highlight)
- `Theme` - Consistent color scheme management
- `clear_screen()` - Screen clearing utility

## Benefits

### For Players

- **War Game**: Never lose progress - save and continue later
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Undo mistakes and try different strategies
- **Hangman**: More enjoyable CLI with colors and easy navigation

### For Developers

- **Reusable Infrastructure**: All systems are in `common/` and ready to use
- **Minimal Integration**: Just a few imports and method calls
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for all APIs
- **Consistent Patterns**: Same approach works across all games

## Code Quality

All changes have been validated:

- ✓ All tests pass (73 passed, 1 skipped)
- ✓ Linting passes (ruff check)
- ✓ Code formatted (black)
- ✓ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✓ Manual testing confirms all features work correctly

## Future Applications

These patterns can be easily applied to other games:

### Save/Load

- Any card game (Poker, Blackjack, Hearts, Spades, etc.)
- Any strategy game (Chess, Checkers, Othello, etc.)
- Any game with long sessions

### Replay/Undo

- All strategy games benefit from undo
- Puzzle games (Sudoku, Minesweeper, etc.)
- Educational games for learning

### CLI Enhancements

- All games with CLI interfaces can benefit
- Especially games with complex menus
- Games targeting terminal enthusiasts

## Example Integration Code

### Adding Save/Load (5 minutes)

```python
# In game engine
from common.architecture.persistence import SaveLoadManager

def to_dict(self) -> dict:
    return {"player_state": self.player, "game_state": self.state}

@classmethod
def from_dict(cls, data: dict):
    game = cls()
    game.player = data["player_state"]
    game.state = data["game_state"]
    return game

# In GUI/CLI
manager = SaveLoadManager()
manager.save("game_name", game.to_dict())  # Save
data = manager.load(filepath)  # Load
game = Game.from_dict(data["state"])  # Restore
```

### Adding Replay/Undo (5 minutes)

```python
# In game engine
from common.architecture.replay import ReplayManager

def __init__(self):
    self.replay_manager = ReplayManager()

def make_move(self, move):
    state_before = self.get_state()
    self.replay_manager.record_action(
        timestamp=time.time(),
        actor=self.current_player,
        action_type="move",
        data={"move": move},
        state_before=state_before
    )
    # Execute move

def undo(self):
    if self.replay_manager.can_undo():
        action = self.replay_manager.undo()
        self.restore_state(action.state_before)
```

### Adding CLI Enhancements (5 minutes)

```python
from common.cli_utils import InteractiveMenu, ASCIIArt, RichText, Theme

theme = Theme()
print(ASCIIArt.banner("GAME NAME", theme.primary))

menu = InteractiveMenu("Main Menu", ["Play", "Options", "Quit"], theme=theme)
choice = menu.display()

print(RichText.success("You won!", theme))
print(RichText.error("Game over!", theme))
```

## Conclusion

These enhancements demonstrate that the infrastructure is production-ready and easy to integrate. Any game in the repository can adopt these features with minimal code changes, providing better user experience and demonstrating the value of the common architecture patterns.
