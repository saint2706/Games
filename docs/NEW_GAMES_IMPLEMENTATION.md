## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Compliance

All games follow the repository's established architecture patterns:

- **GameEngine Interface**: All games extend `common.game_engine.GameEngine`
- **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations throughout
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public methods
- **Abstract Methods**: All required abstract methods implemented:
  - `reset()`
  - `is_game_over()`
  - `get_current_player()`
  - `get_valid_moves()`
  - `make_move()`
  - `get_winner()`
  - `get_game_state()`

### Code Quality

- **Formatting**: All code formatted with Black (160 character line length)
- **Linting**: Passes Ruff linting checks (no errors)
- **Complexity**: Functions kept under complexity threshold
- **Import Organization**: Clean import statements, unused imports removed

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite added in `tests/`:

- `test_dice_games.py` - 9 tests for dice games
- `test_word_games.py` - 14 tests for word games
- `test_logic_games.py` - 16 tests for logic games

**Total**: 39 tests, all passing

### File Structure

Each game follows the standard structure:

```
game_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py          # Package initialization and exports
â”œâ”€â”€ __main__.py          # Entry point for running game
â”œâ”€â”€ game_name.py         # Core game engine logic
â”œâ”€â”€ cli.py               # Command-line interface
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Game-specific documentation
```

## Usage Examples

### Running Games

All games can be run using Python's module syntax:

```bash
# Dice games
python -m dice_games.farkle
python -m dice_games.craps
python -m dice_games.liars_dice
python -m dice_games.bunco

# Word games
python -m word_games.trivia
python -m word_games.crossword

python -m logic_games.picross
```

### Importing Games

Games can be imported and used programmatically:

```python
from dice_games import FarkleGame
from word_games import TriviaGame
from logic_games import MinesweeperGame

# Create game instances
farkle = FarkleGame(num_players=2)
trivia = TriviaGame(num_questions=5)
minesweeper = MinesweeperGame()

# Use game methods
farkle.reset()
farkle.make_move(([], True))  # Roll dice
```

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully adds 13 fully-functional games to the repository, completing the planned expansion into
three new game categories. All games follow established patterns, include comprehensive documentation and tests, and are
ready for immediate use.

The repository now offers a diverse collection of 34 games spanning card games, paper games, dice games, word games, and
logic puzzles, providing users with a rich variety of gaming experiences.
