   python -m paper_games.tic_tac_toe --help

Code Examples
-------------

Programmatic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use any game engine in your code:

.. code-block:: python

   from paper_games.tic_tac_toe.tic_tac_toe import TicTacToe
   
   # Create a game

Troubleshooting
---------------

Common Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Import errors**
   Ensure you're running from the repository root

**Statistics not saving**
   Check permissions for ``~/.games/`` directory

**GUI doesn't start**
   Install tkinter: ``sudo apt-get install python3-tk`` (Linux)

**AI too difficult**
   Try lower difficulty settings where available
