Games Documentation
===================

Welcome to the Games Collection knowledge base. This site documents the Python project that gathers dozens of classic games under a single, unified codebase. Whether you want to launch a quick match from the command line, explore graphical interfaces, or contribute new mechanics, these pages will help you understand how everything fits together.

.. note::
   The documentation has been consolidated into Sphinx so that every audience reads from the same source of truth. Player, developer, operations, and contributor content that previously lived in Markdown files throughout the repository is now organised here.
