Games Documentation

Welcome to the Games Collection knowledge base. This site documents the

codebase. Whether you want to launch a quick match from the command line,
explore graphical interfaces, or contribute new mechanics, these pages will
help you understand how everything fits together.

.. note::
   The documentation was rewritten from the ground up to provide accurate,
   modern guidance. Legacy guides and status reports have been archived in
   the repository history.
