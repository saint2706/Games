:doc:`game_theory`

Educational Features
--------------------

The games collection includes built-in educational features:

Tutorial Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step-by-step tutorials for learning each game:

.. code-block:: python

    from card_games.poker.educational import PokerTutorialMode
    
    tutorial = PokerTutorialMode()
    step = tutorial.get_current_step()
    print(step.title)
    print(step.description)

AI Move Explanations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have the AI explain its decisions:

.. code-block:: python

    # Nim with explanations
    heap_idx, count, explanation = game.computer_move(explain=True)
    print(explanation)
    # "Nim-sum is 2 (winning position). Removing 1 from heap 3 to achieve nim-sum of 0."

Probability Calculators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculate odds during gameplay:

.. code-block:: python

    from card_games.poker.educational import PokerProbabilityCalculator
    
    calc = PokerProbabilityCalculator()
    win_prob = calc.calculate_win_probability(table_state)
    pot_odds_analysis = calc.format_pot_odds_comparison(20, 100, win_prob)
    print(pot_odds_analysis)

Strategy Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get context-aware strategy advice:

.. code-block:: python

    from common import StrategyTipProvider, StrategyTip
    
    tip_provider = StrategyTipProvider()
    tip = tip_provider.get_random_tip()
    print(f"{tip.title}: {tip.description}")

Game Theory Explanations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learn about the algorithms:

.. code-block:: python

    from common import GameTheoryExplainer
    
    explainer = GameTheoryExplainer()
    monte_carlo = explainer.get_explanation("monte_carlo")
    print(monte_carlo.description)
    print(monte_carlo.example)

Practice and Improvement
-------------------------

Tips for Improving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Start with basics:** Master fundamental strategy before advanced techniques
2. **Use educational mode:** Enable tutorials and hints when learning
3. **Analyze decisions:** Review why certain plays are optimal
4. **Practice regularly:** Consistent practice builds intuition
5. **Learn from mistakes:** Pay attention to suboptimal decisions
6. **Study theory:** Understanding the math improves decision-making
7. **Adjust to opponents:** Observe patterns and adapt strategy

Recommended Learning Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Beginners:**

1. Complete tutorial mode for chosen game
2. Read basic strategy guide
3. Practice with hints enabled
4. Focus on avoiding common mistakes

**Intermediate:**

1. Study probability calculations
2. Learn game theory concepts
3. Practice without hints
4. Experiment with different strategies

**Advanced:**

1. Master optimal play (minimax, GTO)
2. Understand opponent exploitation
3. Study advanced concepts (Nash equilibrium, etc.)
4. Compete in tournament modes
