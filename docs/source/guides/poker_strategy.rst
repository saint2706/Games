Poker Strategy Guide
====================

This guide covers fundamental poker strategy, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

Understanding Hand Strength
----------------------------

Pre-Flop Hand Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all starting hands are created equal. Here's a tier system:

**Premium Hands (Top 2%):**
* AA, KK, QQ, JJ - Always raise
* AK suited - Strong starting hand

**Strong Hands (Top 5%):**
* TT, 99, 88
* AK offsuit, AQ suited
* Raise from any position

**Playable Hands (Top 15%):**
* 77-22 (small pairs)
* Suited connectors (JTs, T9s, 98s)
* A-x suited (Ace with any suited card)
* Play from middle/late position

**Marginal Hands:**
* K-x suited, Q-x suited
* Suited one-gaps (J9s, T8s)
* Only play from late position or as blind defense

**Trash Hands:**
* Offsuit hands with gaps (T7o, 95o, etc.)
* Low unconnected cards
* Fold these hands!

Position Strategy
-----------------

The Importance of Position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Position is one of the most critical concepts in poker. Acting last gives you:

1. **Information advantage** - See what others do before your decision
2. **Bluffing opportunities** - Easier to represent hands
3. **Value extraction** - Can bet for value more confidently
4. **Pot control** - Can check behind to limit losses

Betting Strategy
----------------

Pot Odds and Expected Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Pot Odds Formula:**

.. code-block:: text

   Pot Odds = Amount to Call / (Pot + Amount to Call)

**Example:**

.. code-block:: text

   Pot: $100
   Bet to call: $20
   Pot odds = $20 / ($100 + $20) = 16.7%

   If you have >16.7% equity, calling is profitable!

Common Mistakes to Avoid
------------------------

**1. Playing Too Many Hands**
   Most losing players play too loose. Be selective!

**2. Ignoring Position**
   Position is power. Don't play the same hands from all positions.

**3. Poor Bankroll Management**
   Going broke ends your poker career. Play within your means.
