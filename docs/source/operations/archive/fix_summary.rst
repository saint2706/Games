Workflow Fix Summary - Run #18444149184
=======================================

Problem Analysis
----------------

GitHub Actions workflow run
`#18444149184 <https://github.com/saint2706/Games/actions/runs/18444149184>`__
failed during the ‚ÄúFix lint warnings‚Äù step.

Root Cause
~~~~~~~~~~

The workflow file ``.github/workflows/format-and-lint.yml`` executes the
following steps:

1. Run formatters: ``black .`` and ``mdformat .``
2. Fix lint warnings: ``ruff check . --fix``
3. Commit changes (if any)

The workflow failed at step 2 because ``ruff`` found 3 unused variables
that could not be auto-fixed:

::

   F841 Local variable `lead_suit` is assigned to but never used
      --> card_games/euchre/game.py:246:9

   F841 Local variable `defending_tricks` is assigned to but never used
      --> card_games/euchre/game.py:268:9

   F841 Local variable `reporter` is assigned to but never used
      --> tests/test_crash_reporter.py:125:9

Additionally, 11 markdown files were not formatted according to
``mdformat`` standards.

Solution Implemented
--------------------

1. Fixed Unused Variables (Code Quality)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

card_games/euchre/game.py (line 246)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Before:**

.. code:: python

   # Lead suit
   lead_suit = self.current_trick[0][1].suit

   # Find highest card

**After:**

.. code:: python

   # Find highest card

**Reasoning:** The ``lead_suit`` variable was extracted but never used
in the logic. The comment suggested it was planned to be used, but the
current implementation doesn‚Äôt need it.

card_games/euchre/game.py (line 268)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Before:**

.. code:: python

   defending_team = 2 if making_team == 1 else 1
   making_tricks = self.tricks_won[making_team - 1]
   defending_tricks = self.tricks_won[defending_team - 1]

   if making_tricks >= 3:

**After:**

.. code:: python

   defending_team = 2 if making_team == 1 else 1
   making_tricks = self.tricks_won[making_team - 1]

   if making_tricks >= 3:

**Reasoning:** The ``defending_tricks`` variable was calculated but
never referenced. The scoring logic only needs to check the making
team‚Äôs tricks.

tests/test_crash_reporter.py (line 125)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Before:**

.. code:: python

   with patch("pathlib.Path.home", return_value=tmp_path):
       reporter = install_global_exception_handler("test_game")

       # Simulate KeyboardInterrupt

**After:**

.. code:: python

   with patch("pathlib.Path.home", return_value=tmp_path):
       install_global_exception_handler("test_game")

       # Simulate KeyboardInterrupt

**Reasoning:** The test installs the global exception handler but
doesn‚Äôt need to inspect the returned reporter object. The test validates
the handler‚Äôs behavior, not the reporter instance.

2. Fixed Markdown Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ran ``mdformat .`` to format 11 markdown files:

-  ``.github/workflows/events/README.md``
-  ``CHANGELOG.md``
-  ``operations/archive/debug_report``
-  ``card_games/cribbage/README.md``
-  ``card_games/euchre/README.md``
-  ``card_games/rummy500/README.md``
-  ``docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md``
-  ``developers/guides/implementation_notes``
-  ``developers/guides/local_workflows``
-  ``developers/guides/workflow_testing_quickstart``
-  ``scripts/README.md``

**Changes:** Primary changes were adding blank lines after section
headers for consistency with markdown best practices.

Verification
------------

All workflow checks now pass:

.. code:: bash

   # Python formatting
   $ black --check .
   All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
   301 files would be left unchanged.

   # Markdown formatting
   $ mdformat --check .
   # (no output - success)

   # Linting
   $ ruff check .
   All checks passed!

Tests also pass:

.. code:: bash

   $ pytest tests/test_crash_reporter.py::test_global_exception_handler_keyboard_interrupt -v
   PASSED [100%]

Impact
------

-  **No functional changes** - Only code quality improvements
-  **No test failures** - All existing tests still pass
-  **Workflow should now succeed** - All linting and formatting checks
   pass

Why These Fixes Were Necessary
------------------------------

The ``ruff check . --fix`` command can auto-fix many issues, but F841
(unused variable) errors require the ``--unsafe-fixes`` flag because
removing code could change program behavior. However, in these cases:

1. The variables were genuinely unused (no references)
2. Removing them doesn‚Äôt change any logic
3. Manual verification confirmed safety

The workflow is designed correctly - it should fail when there are code
quality issues that can‚Äôt be safely auto-fixed, prompting developers to
manually review and fix them.

Recommendations
---------------

1. **Keep the workflow as-is** - It‚Äôs working correctly by catching code
   quality issues
2. **Run pre-commit hooks locally** - Helps catch these issues before
   pushing
3. **Use ``make lint`` before committing** - The Makefile has convenient
   targets for all checks
