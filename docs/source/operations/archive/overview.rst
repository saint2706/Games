Workflow Documentation Archive
==============================

This directory stores historical workflow documentation that is still
useful for reference but no longer part of the core workflow guides.

Archived Documents
------------------

- ``operations/archive/debug_report`` – Deep dive into past CI failures and debugging sessions.
- ``operations/archive/fix_summary`` – Summary of workflow fixes that have since been upstreamed into the main guides.
- ``operations/archive/how_to_fix_v1_1_1`` – Step-by-step remediation plan for the v1.1.1 release issue.
- ``operations/archive/pypi_publish_debug_run_18520989869`` – Detailed breakdown of a historical PyPI publish failure.

Each file remains accessible for institutional knowledge while allowing
the primary ``docs/workflows/`` directory to focus on the current
validation and maintenance tooling.
