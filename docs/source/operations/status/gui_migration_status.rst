Migration Guidelines
--------------------

For detailed migration instructions, see:

-  GUI Migration Guide (developers/gui/migration_guide)
-  PyQt5 Implementation Summary (developers/gui/pyqt5_implementation)
-  GUI Frameworks Documentation (developers/gui/frameworks)

Quick Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create ``gui_pyqt.py`` alongside existing ``gui.py``
2. Import PyQt5 widgets and base class from ``common.gui_base_pyqt``
3. Convert widget mappings (see migration guide)
4. Update event handlers from Tkinter to PyQt5 signals/slots
5. Convert layouts from pack/grid to QVBoxLayout/QHBoxLayout
6. Add tests in ``tests/test_gui_pyqt.py``
7. Update this status file
8. Update documentation files

Migration Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All games have been successfully migrated to PyQt5. The migration was
completed in order of increasing complexity:

1.  âœ… **Go Fish** - Simplest card game GUI
2.  âœ… **Dots and Boxes** - Proof of concept for paper games
3.  âœ… **Poker** - Moderate complexity with betting
4.  âœ… **Bluff** - Multi-player interaction
5.  âœ… **Crazy Eights** - Special card rules
6.  âœ… **Bridge** - Complex bidding system
7.  âœ… **Uno** - Special cards and colors
8.  âœ… **Spades** - Trick-taking with bidding
9.  âœ… **Hearts** - Trick-taking with point avoidance
10. âœ… **Battleship** - Complex board interaction
11. âœ… **War** - Animations and war mechanics
12. âœ… **Blackjack** - Betting and dealer logic
13. âœ… **Gin Rummy** - Complex melding system
14. âœ… **Canasta** - Advanced melding with canastas
15. âœ… **Pinochle** - Bidding and melding combination
16. âœ… **Solitaire** - Most complex GUI with toolbar and canvas

Testing
-------

All PyQt5 GUIs must include:

-  Import test in ``tests/test_gui_pyqt.py``
-  Initialization test (with display skip for CI)
-  Widget creation verification
-  Integration with existing game engine

Dependencies
------------

PyQt5 is installed as an optional dependency:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e ".[gui]"

Or directly:

.. code:: bash

   pip install pyqt5>=5.15

Migration Complete
------------------

The PyQt5 migration is now complete for all 16 games with GUI support.
The migration successfully:

-  âœ… Converted all Tkinter GUIs to PyQt5
-  âœ… Maintained feature parity with original implementations
-  âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage
-  âœ… Updated all documentation
-  âœ… Ensured cross-platform compatibility
-  âœ… Improved GUI responsiveness and appearance

For future GUI development, use the PyQt5 framework and refer to:

-  ``src/games_collection/core/gui_base_pyqt.py`` - Base GUI class
-  Existing implementations as examples
-  Migration guide for reference patterns
