# Workflow Documentation Archive

This directory stores historical workflow documentation that is still useful for reference but no longer part of the core workflow guides.

## Archived Documents

- [DEBUG_REPORT.md](DEBUG_REPORT.md) – Deep dive into past CI failures and debugging sessions.
- [FIX_SUMMARY.md](FIX_SUMMARY.md) – Summary of workflow fixes that have since been upstreamed into the main guides.
- [HOW_TO_FIX_V1_1_1.md](HOW_TO_FIX_V1_1_1.md) – Step-by-step remediation plan for the v1.1.1 release issue.
- [PYPI_PUBLISH_DEBUG_RUN_18520989869.md](PYPI_PUBLISH_DEBUG_RUN_18520989869.md) – Detailed breakdown of a historical PyPI publish failure.

Each file remains accessible for institutional knowledge while allowing the primary `docs/workflows/` directory to focus on the current validation and maintenance tooling.
