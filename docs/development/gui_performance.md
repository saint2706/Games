# PyQt GUI Performance Guidelines

This document captures the findings from auditing the PyQt update flows and
describes the new throttling utilities available to widget authors.

## Audit summary

| Module | Hot path | Previous behaviour | Updated behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `core/gui_base_pyqt.py` | `BaseGUI.update_display` was invoked directly from game controllers. | Every call executed immediately and refreshed the whole layout. | Introduced `request_update_display()` to coalesce work via a single-shot `QTimer`. Regions can be marked dirty so only the required widgets repaint. |
| `games/card/hearts/gui_pyqt.py` | Passing and trick resolution spammed `update_display()` while toggling hint labels. | The scoreboard, trick arena, and status banner repainted on every call. | Calls now mark `status`/`trick`/`scoreboard` regions explicitly and `update_display()` honours `should_update_region()`. |
| `games/card/gin_rummy/gui_pyqt.py` | Draw/discard loops triggered multiple refreshes as the hand changed. | Entire table redrew after each draw, causing deadwood analysis to re-run repeatedly. | Dirty-region signals differentiate between `hand`, `scoreboard`, `status`, `discard`, `stock`, and `badges`, minimising redundant calculations. |

The remaining PyQt game UIs already benefit from throttling through
`request_update_display()`. They default to full repaints until they are
incrementally annotated.

## Using the throttling helpers

* Prefer `self.request_update_display({"status", "hand"})` over calling
  `self.update_display()` directly.
* When a change must be visible immediately (e.g., right after layout
  construction), pass `immediate=True`.
* Inside `update_display()` call `self.should_update_region("name")` before
  performing expensive work. The helper returns `True` whenever a full repaint
  was requested.
* Metadata can be attached via `self.mark_dirty("log", highlight=True)` and
  then consumed from `self.current_dirty_metadata`.

## Testing expectations

`tests/gui/test_pyqt_update_throttling.py` introduces Qt bot driven tests that
simulate bursty update requests. The assertions verify that multiple logical
regions are coalesced into a single repaint and that the timer prevents more
than a handful of frames when 10 updates are requested back-to-back. These
tests serve as a baseline for future GUIs that adopt the throttling helpers.

## Best practices

1. Group updates logically. Repaint only the sections whose state actually
   changedâ€”hands, scoreboards, status banners, etc.
2. Defer heavy analysis (e.g., scoring calculations) until the corresponding
   region is dirty. This keeps AI-driven games responsive when opponents play
   quickly.
3. Keep accessibility hooks intact by updating focusable widgets inside
   `update_display()`. When skipping a region, ensure any assistive text that
   depends on it is still updated elsewhere.
4. Document new regions in the module docstring so other contributors know how
   to signal updates.
