- Game duration tracking
- Win streak tracking (current and longest)
- Total games played statistics
- Easy integration with CLI arguments

### Architecture

Each game follows the standard pattern:

- `game.py` - Core game engine with no UI dependencies
- `cli.py` - Command-line interface
- `__main__.py` - Entry point with argument parsing
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `__init__.py` - Package initialization

### Code Quality

- ✅ Extends GameEngine base class
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Formatted with black (160 char)
- ✅ Linted with ruff
- ✅ Follows repository patterns
