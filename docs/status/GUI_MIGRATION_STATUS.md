## Migration Guidelines

For detailed migration instructions, see:

- [GUI Migration Guide](../gui/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [PyQt5 Implementation Summary](../gui/PYQT5_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- [GUI Frameworks Documentation](../gui/FRAMEWORKS.md)

### Quick Steps

1. Create `gui_pyqt.py` alongside existing `gui.py`
1. Import PyQt5 widgets and base class from `common.gui_base_pyqt`
1. Convert widget mappings (see migration guide)
1. Update event handlers from Tkinter to PyQt5 signals/slots
1. Convert layouts from pack/grid to QVBoxLayout/QHBoxLayout
1. Add tests in `tests/test_gui_pyqt.py`
1. Update this status file
1. Update documentation files

### Migration Timeline

All games have been successfully migrated to PyQt5. The migration was completed in order of increasing complexity:

1. âœ… **Go Fish** - Simplest card game GUI
1. âœ… **Dots and Boxes** - Proof of concept for paper games
1. âœ… **Poker** - Moderate complexity with betting
1. âœ… **Bluff** - Multi-player interaction
1. âœ… **Crazy Eights** - Special card rules
1. âœ… **Bridge** - Complex bidding system
1. âœ… **Uno** - Special cards and colors
1. âœ… **Spades** - Trick-taking with bidding
1. âœ… **Hearts** - Trick-taking with point avoidance
1. âœ… **Battleship** - Complex board interaction
1. âœ… **War** - Animations and war mechanics
1. âœ… **Blackjack** - Betting and dealer logic
1. âœ… **Gin Rummy** - Complex melding system
1. âœ… **Canasta** - Advanced melding with canastas
1. âœ… **Pinochle** - Bidding and melding combination
1. âœ… **Solitaire** - Most complex GUI with toolbar and canvas

## Testing

All PyQt5 GUIs must include:

- Import test in `tests/test_gui_pyqt.py`
- Initialization test (with display skip for CI)
- Widget creation verification
- Integration with existing game engine

## Dependencies

PyQt5 is installed as an optional dependency:

```bash
pip install -e ".[gui]"
```

Or directly:

```bash
pip install pyqt5>=5.15
```

## Migration Complete

The PyQt5 migration is now complete for all 16 games with GUI support. The migration successfully:

- âœ… Converted all Tkinter GUIs to PyQt5
- âœ… Maintained feature parity with original implementations
- âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… Updated all documentation
- âœ… Ensured cross-platform compatibility
- âœ… Improved GUI responsiveness and appearance

For future GUI development, use the PyQt5 framework and refer to:

- `common/gui_base_pyqt.py` - Base GUI class
- Existing implementations as examples
- Migration guide for reference patterns
