### 4. Universal Statistics System

**Files**: `card_games/common/stats.py` (232 lines)

A reusable wrapper around the existing `common/analytics/game_stats.py` system, specifically tailored for card games.

**Features**:
- Win/loss/draw tracking per player
- Game duration tracking
- Win streak tracking (current and longest)
- Leaderboards sorted by wins and win rate
- Persistent JSON storage in `~/.game_stats/`
- Easy integration with any card game
- Optional score tracking
- Player statistics display
- Leaderboard display

**Integration Example**:
```python
from card_games.common.stats import CardGameStats

# Initialize for a game
stats = CardGameStats("poker")

# Record game results
stats.record_win("Alice", duration=120.5, score=500)
stats.record_loss("Bob", duration=120.5, score=250)
stats.save()

# Display stats
stats.display_player_stats("Alice")
stats.display_leaderboard()

# Get programmatic access
player_stats = stats.get_player_stats("Alice")
# Returns: {total_games, wins, losses, draws, win_rate, ...}

leaderboard = stats.get_leaderboard(limit=10)
# Returns: [{player_name, wins, total_games, win_rate}, ...]
```

**CLI Integration Pattern**:
```python
# Add arguments
parser.add_argument("--leaderboard", action="store_true")
parser.add_argument("--show-stats", action="store_true")
parser.add_argument("--no-stats", action="store_true")
parser.add_argument("--player", type=str)

# Handle display commands
if args.leaderboard:
    stats = CardGameStats("game_name")
    stats.display_leaderboard()
    return

if args.show_stats:
    stats = CardGameStats("game_name")
    stats.display_player_stats(args.player or "Player 1")
    return

# Record during gameplay
stats = CardGameStats("game_name")
stats.record_win(winner, duration)
stats.record_loss(loser, duration)
stats.save()
```

## Code Quality Metrics

All code follows repository standards:

- ✅ **Type Hints**: All functions have full type annotations
- ✅ **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings on all public APIs
- ✅ **Formatting**: Black formatted (160 character line length)
- ✅ **Linting**: Ruff compliant with no violations
- ✅ **Complexity**: Functions kept simple and focused
- ✅ **Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns (game/cli/main)
- ✅ **Testing**: Deterministic gameplay with seed support for easy testing
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README for each game

---

## Architecture Patterns Established

Each game follows a consistent structure:

```
game_name/
├── __init__.py          # Package exports
├── __main__.py          # Entry point with CLI args
├── game.py             # Pure game logic, no UI
├── cli.py              # Command-line interface
└── README.md           # User documentation
```

**Key Principles**:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Game logic independent of UI
2. **Deterministic**: Seed support for reproducible games
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add GUI, AI, or network play
4. **Testable**: Pure functions make testing straightforward
5. **Documented**: Clear docstrings and user guides
6. **Consistent**: Same patterns across all games
