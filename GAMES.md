# Games Catalog

The detailed catalogue now lives in the Sphinx documentation. Visit [docs/source/players/games_catalog.rst](docs/source/players/games_catalog.rst) for the authoritative listings or build the HTML documentation and open `docs/build/html/players/games_catalog.html`.

This Markdown file remains only as a pointer so contributors know where to update the canonical record.
