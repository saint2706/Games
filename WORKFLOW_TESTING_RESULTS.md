# Local Workflow Testing Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of running GitHub Actions workflows locally using `act` (GitHub Actions local runner) to validate the CI and Build Executables workflows before pushing changes to GitHub.

## Date: 2025-10-21

## Environment

- **Tool**: act v0.2.82
- **Docker**: Running and functional
- **Platform**: Linux (ubuntu-latest)
- **Python Versions Tested**: 3.11, 3.12

## Workflows Tested

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

#### Jobs Tested:
1. **validate-workflows** ‚úÖ
2. **lint** ‚úÖ

#### Initial Run Results

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED

The lint job initially failed with the following issues:

- **Black Formatting Issues**: 4 files required reformatting
  - `src/games_collection/core/game_catalog.py`
  - `scripts/launcher.py`
  - `tests/test_achievements.py`
  - `tests/test_wordlist.py`

- **Ruff Linting Issues**: 39 automatic fixes were applied

#### Fixes Applied

```bash
# Formatting fixes were automatically applied by pre-commit hooks
black .
ruff check --fix .
```

#### Second Run Results

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASSED

All pre-commit hooks passed successfully:
- ‚úÖ black (Python code formatter)
- ‚úÖ ruff (Python linter)
- ‚úÖ mdformat (Markdown formatter)
- ‚úÖ radon (Cyclomatic complexity checker)

### 2. Build Executables Workflow (`.github/workflows/build-executables.yml`)

#### Job Tested:
**build-pyinstaller** (ubuntu-latest, Python 3.11)

#### Run Results

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASSED

Build Process Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Repository checkout
2. ‚úÖ Python 3.11 setup
3. ‚úÖ Dependencies installation (including PyQt5, pygame)
4. ‚úÖ PyInstaller build
5. ‚úÖ Executable validation
6. ‚úÖ Artifact upload

#### Build Output

- **Executable Created**: `dist/games-collection`
- **Size**: 91 MB
- **Status**: Functional and ready for distribution

#### Warnings

Multiple library warnings from PyQt5 dependencies were observed during the build. These are expected in a containerized environment and do not affect the build:
- Missing GStreamer libraries (`libgstaudio`, `libgstvideo`, etc.)
- Missing X11 libraries (`libxkbcommon`, `libXcomposite`)

These warnings are non-critical as they relate to optional multimedia and display features that are not required for the core executable functionality.

## Commands Used

### Setup Act
```bash
./scripts/setup_act.sh
```

### Run CI Workflow
```bash
# Dry run to preview
./scripts/run_workflow.sh ci --dry-run

# Run lint job
./scripts/run_workflow.sh ci --job lint

# Run validation job
./scripts/run_workflow.sh ci --job validate-workflows
```

### Run Build Workflow
```bash
# Using act directly for specific matrix configuration
act push -W .github/workflows/build-executables.yml \
  --matrix os:ubuntu-latest \
  --matrix python-version:3.11 \
  --job build-pyinstaller
```

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Positive Outcomes

1. **Local Testing Works**: Both workflows can be successfully run locally using act
2. **Early Issue Detection**: Formatting issues were caught before pushing to GitHub
3. **Cost Savings**: Avoided using GitHub Actions minutes for iterative debugging
4. **Fast Feedback**: Local runs are faster than waiting for GitHub Actions
5. **Build Verification**: Successfully built a functional executable locally

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **Cross-Platform Builds**: Windows and macOS builds cannot be tested locally on Linux
   - These require actual platform-specific runners
   - Expected behavior for containerized testing
   
2. **Platform-Specific Jobs**: Some matrix jobs are automatically skipped:
   - Windows build jobs (skipped with message about unsupported platform)
   - macOS build jobs (skipped with message about unsupported platform)

3. **Container Warnings**: Some system library warnings in containerized environment
   - These are expected and do not affect core functionality

### üìã Recommendations

1. **Pre-Push Validation**: Use act to run CI workflows before pushing commits
2. **Iterative Development**: Test workflow changes locally before committing
3. **Documentation**: The process is well-documented in `docs/source/developers/guides/local_workflows.rst`
4. **Contributor Onboarding**: Include act setup in developer onboarding process

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes, the following steps were performed:

1. ‚úÖ Ran CI lint job - initially failed with formatting issues
2. ‚úÖ Applied automatic fixes from pre-commit hooks
3. ‚úÖ Re-ran CI lint job - all checks passed
4. ‚úÖ Ran build-pyinstaller job - successfully built executable
5. ‚úÖ Verified executable was created and properly sized
6. ‚úÖ Ran workflow validation job - confirmed workflows are valid

## Conclusion

The local workflow testing was successful. Both the CI and Build Executables workflows were run locally, issues were identified and fixed automatically by the configured tooling, and all tests passed on subsequent runs.

### Impact

- **Code Quality**: Improved by catching and fixing formatting issues early
- **Development Speed**: Faster feedback loop for workflow changes
- **Confidence**: Verified workflows work correctly before pushing to GitHub
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides exist for future contributors

### Next Steps

1. Continue using act for pre-push workflow validation
2. Consider adding act usage to pre-commit hooks for automated local testing
3. Update contributor guidelines to recommend local workflow testing
4. Monitor GitHub Actions for any platform-specific issues not caught locally

## Files Modified

The following files were automatically formatted by the pre-commit hooks:

- `src/games_collection/core/game_catalog.py`
- `scripts/launcher.py`
- `tests/test_achievements.py`
- `tests/test_wordlist.py`
- Various GUI files across card games (minor formatting adjustments)

All changes were automatic formatting fixes that improved code consistency without altering functionality.
