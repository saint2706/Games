"""A simple game example demonstrating the use of core base classes.

This script illustrates how to structure a basic game by inheriting from the
`GameEngine` abstract base class. It also shows how to implement and integrate
different AI behaviors using the `RandomStrategy` and `HeuristicStrategy` classes.

The game implemented here is a classic Number Guessing Game, which provides a
clear and straightforward context for these architectural patterns.
