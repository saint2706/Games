"""This script provides a live demonstration of the core architectural components.

It showcases the interplay between the following systems:
- PluginManager: For discovering and loading game modules dynamically.
- Event System: For decoupled communication between game components.
- Observer Pattern: For state change notifications.
- SettingsManager: For managing persistent game settings.
- ReplayManager: For recording and replaying game sessions, including undo/redo.
- SaveLoadManager: For saving and loading game states.

The demonstration simulates a simple number guessing game to illustrate these concepts
in a practical context.
