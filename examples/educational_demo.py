"""This script demonstrates the various educational features available in the Games Collection.

It showcases how different components can be used to create an enriching learning
experience for players, helping them understand game mechanics, strategy, and
underlying mathematical concepts.

The demonstrations cover:
- Step-by-step tutorial modes for specific games (Poker, Blackjack).
- Probability calculators to analyze game situations (e.g., pot odds, bust probability).
- A game theory explainer for core concepts like Minimax and Monte Carlo.
- A dynamic strategy tip system.
- Curated challenge packs to test and improve player skills.
- Integration of educational features within a game (Nim).
