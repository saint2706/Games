- Blinds increase every 5 hands by default (configurable)
- Integrated blind updates into `PokerMatch.play_cli()`

### 4. Pot-Limit and No-Limit Betting Options ✅

**Implementation Details:**

- Filename format: `poker_history_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

**Usage:**
History files are automatically saved in the working directory after each match.

**JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "game_variant": "omaha",
  "betting_limit": "pot-limit",
  "tournament_mode": true,
  "hands": [
    {
      "hand_number": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-10T20:28:13.555240",
      "players": { ... },
      "hole_cards": { ... },
