"""Command-line interface for the Minesweeper game.

This module provides a full-featured, text-based version of the classic
Minesweeper puzzle. It allows players to choose from standard difficulty
levels, interact with the game board, and receive feedback on their
progress.

The main game loop handles user input for selecting difficulty, making
moves (revealing, flagging, etc.), and displaying the board state after
each turn. The game ends when the player either reveals all non-mine
cells or hits a mine.
