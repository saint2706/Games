# Unscramble - New Features

This document describes the enhanced features added to the Unscramble word game.

## Features Overview

### 1. Difficulty-Based Word Selection

The game now includes three difficulty levels based on word length:

- **Easy**: 6+ letter words (360 words) - More letters make patterns easier to spot
- **Medium**: 4-5 letter words (360 words) - Balanced challenge
- **Hard**: 3 letter words (360 words) - Very challenging with fewer letters
- **Mixed**: All difficulties combined (1,080 words)

**How to Use:**

```python
from paper_games.unscramble import load_words_by_difficulty, UnscrambleGame

# Load specific difficulty
easy_words = load_words_by_difficulty("easy")
medium_words = load_words_by_difficulty("medium")
hard_words = load_words_by_difficulty("hard")

# Create game with difficulty
game = UnscrambleGame(words=easy_words, difficulty="easy")
```

### 2. Themed Word Packs

Five themed word categories are now available:

- **Technical**: Programming and computer science terms (49 words)
- **Literature**: Literary terms and concepts (48 words)

    else:
        print(f"Wrong! It was '{game.secret_word}'")
```

### Themed Game with Statistics

```python
from paper_games.unscramble import (
    UnscrambleGame,
    GameStats,
    load_themed_words
)
from pathlib import Path
import time

# Load stats and theme
stats = GameStats.load(Path.home() / ".games" / "unscramble_stats.json")
tech_words = load_themed_words("technical")
game = UnscrambleGame(words=tech_words, theme="technical")

# Play with time tracking
scrambled = game.new_round()
start_time = time.time()
guess = input(f"Unscramble: {scrambled} > ")
time_taken = time.time() - start_time

solved = game.guess(guess)
stats.record_word(
    solved=solved,
    theme="technical",
    time_taken=time_taken
)

# Check achievements
new_achievements = stats.check_achievements()
if new_achievements:
    print(f"New achievements: {', '.join(new_achievements)}")

# Save stats
stats.save(Path.home() / ".games" / "unscramble_stats.json")
```

### Multiplayer Game

```python
from paper_games.unscramble import UnscrambleGame

players = [
    {"name": "Alice", "score": 0},
    {"name": "Bob", "score": 0}
]

game = UnscrambleGame()

for round_num in range(5):
    game.new_round()
    print(f"\nRound {round_num + 1}: {game.scrambled}")
    
    for player in players:
        print(f"\n{player['name']}'s turn:")
        guess = input("Your guess: ")
        if game.guess(guess):
            print("Correct!")
            player["score"] += 1
            break
    else:
        print(f"No one got it! It was '{game.secret_word}'")

# Show results
winner = max(players, key=lambda p: p["score"])
print(f"\n{winner['name']} wins with {winner['score']} points!")
```

## Statistics File Location

Statistics are automatically saved to:

```
~/.games/unscramble_stats.json
```

This file contains:

- All word attempt history (aggregated)
- Streak information
- Achievements unlocked
- Time tracking data
- Stats by difficulty and theme

## Command Line Interface

When running the game via CLI:

```bash
python -m paper_games.unscramble
```

You'll be presented with:

1. Option to view existing statistics
1. Game mode selection (Classic/Timed/Multiplayer)
1. Difficulty selection
1. Theme selection (optional)
1. Game-specific options (rounds, timer duration, player count)
1. Achievement notifications
1. Final statistics summary

## Implementation Notes

### Word Selection

Words are selected randomly from the chosen difficulty or theme. Each word is scrambled by shuffling its letters, ensuring the scrambled version is different from the original word.

### Time Tracking

Time is tracked using Python's `time.time()` for precise measurements. Times are recorded in seconds with decimal precision.

### Statistics Persistence

Statistics are saved as JSON files with human-readable formatting. The file is created automatically on first use.

### Achievements

Achievements are checked after each game session. Once unlocked, achievements persist permanently in the statistics file.

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:

- Hint system (reveal one letter)
- Hint penalties (time or point deduction)
- Online multiplayer with real-time competition
- Leaderboards
- Daily challenges
- Custom word pack creation
- Progressive difficulty (words get harder as you progress)
- Combo multipliers for consecutive fast solves
- Power-ups (extra time, letter reveal, shuffle)
