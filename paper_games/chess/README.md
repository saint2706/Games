# Chess

Full chess implementation with all standard rules.

## How to Play

Standard chess rules with all pieces, special moves, and win conditions.

**Run the game**: `python -m paper_games.chess`

## Planned Features

- All chess pieces with correct movement
- Castling (kingside and queenside)
- En passant capture
- Pawn promotion
- Check and checkmate detection
- Stalemate detection
- Chess engine (minimax or neural network)
- Opening book integration

## Implementation Status

âœ… Basic board structure
âœ… Simple pawn movement
ðŸ”„ All pieces and rules pending
ðŸ”„ Chess engine pending

## Note

Full chess implementation is a substantial project. This basic version demonstrates
the structure. A complete implementation would require:
- Move generation for all pieces
- Legal move validation (including check)
- Game state evaluation
- AI opponent (minimax with alpha-beta pruning or neural network)
- Opening book and endgame tablebase
