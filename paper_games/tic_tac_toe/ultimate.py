"""Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game logic and state management.

This module implements the rules and gameplay for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, a
variant of the classic game played on a 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 boards.
The core concept is that a move in a small board dictates which board the
opponent must play in next.

The `UltimateTicTacToeGame` class manages the overall game state, including:
- A grid of 9 `TicTacToeGame` instances for the small boards.
- A "meta-board" to track which player has won each small board.
- The logic for determining the active board for the next move.
- A simple AI for the computer opponent.

Key Game Rules:
1. To win the game, a player must win three small boards in a row on the
   meta-board.
2. The cell where a player makes a move determines the board where the
   opponent must play next. For example, a move in the top-left cell of a
   small board sends the opponent to the top-left board.
3. If the target board is already won or drawn, the opponent can play on
   any available board.
